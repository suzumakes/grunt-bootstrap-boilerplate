##Ready to Build Your Site?

Most boilerplates are pretty complex, incorporating a lot of different technologies and frameworks. Honestly, some of them are bewildering in their complexity. This boilerplate provides an easy introduction into using Grunt to automate preparing your _static html site_ for deployment.

Everything will have copious documentation.

###What does this do?

* you edit the src -- Grunt publishes to root
* process Sass/SCSS to CSS
* minify and combine JS
* reuse PHP style includes in html
* compress or copy images from src to root

###Grunt Installation

Including the node_modules in the repo is an awful idea, so let's get to installing Grunt. If you haven't, install the Grunt CLI.

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Now that you have that taken care of, it's extremely simple to get everything ready. Fork the repo or clone it,

    npm install

Get yourself a drink, this could take a few minutes.

###Bower Installation

Front-end assets are maintained and updated with Bower (look I'll update this Readme a lot later today ok?), and the bower.json file specifies the packages needed, so if you want to get started, just type:

    bower install

###Ready to build your site?

Put your files in source, I'll expound more later, but run Grunt with the default command: "grunt" and you're off and running!

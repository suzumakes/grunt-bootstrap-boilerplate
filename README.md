#Hey!

###Why another boilerplate?

Most boilerplates are pretty complex, incorporating a lot of different technologies and frameworks. Honestly, some of them are bewildering in their complexity. This boilerplate provides an easy introduction into using Grunt to automate preparing your _static html site_ for deployment.

Everything will have copious documentation.

###What does it do?

* you edit the src -- Grunt publishes to root
* process Sass/SCSS to CSS
* minify and combine JS
* reuse PHP style includes in html
* compress or copy images from src to root

###Installation

Including the node_modules in the repo is an awful idea, so let's get to installing Grunt. If you haven't, install the Grunt CLI.

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Now that you have that taken care of, it's extremely simple to get everything ready.

    npm install

Get yourself a drink, this could take a few minutes.
